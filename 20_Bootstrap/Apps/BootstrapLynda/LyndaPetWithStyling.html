                <h1> Our Veterinarians Bring Extensive Experience</h1>
                <p>Wisdom Pet Medicine was founded by Dr. Darren Winthrop, Dr. Elizabeth Chase, and Dr. Kimberly Sanders
                    to bring the best in traditional and alternative medicine to the local community. The three doctors
                    met while pursuing their veterinary education at Colorado State University, one of the nation's
                    top-rated vet schools. After going their own ways (for almost a decade), to work for different
                    veterinary clinics across the country, the doctors decided it was time to combine their diverse
                    knowledge and skills under one practice at Wisdom Pet Medicine.</p>
                <p>Staying up on the latest technology and procedures, empowers us to diagnose and treat more conditions
                    in-house, rather than having to ship your pet out to a specialist's office. Our goal is to help keep
                    your love ones comfortable by keeping them in friendly and familiar surroundings for the duration of
                    their care. </p>
                <p>Our veterinary hospital provides general and specialty vet medicine, and serves as a major surgical
                    center in the region. We're often referred difficult cases from other vet clinics throughout the
                    region, state, and country, and even treat cases from other countries. </p>
                <p>We all love animals and strive to make your pet's experience as positive as possible. This is why we
                    have a pet play yard in the back of our clinic where we give our overnight visitors regular time
                    away from the stress of confinement and treatment. </p>
                <p>We are proud to say that most of our patients come in wagging their tails happily on return visits â€“
                    a true indicator that we've made them feel safe and secure. We're honored that you've entrusted your
                    pet's care to us, and we'll stand by our commitment to provide the absolute best in veterinary
                    medicine.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Winthrop is the guardian of Missy, a three-year old Llaso mix, who he adopted at the
                                shelter (he just couldn't resist those sad eyes). Dr. Winthrop is passionate about spay and
                                neuter and pet adoption, and works tireless hours outside the clinic, performing free spay
                                and neuter surgeries for the shelter.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Chase spends much of her free time helping the local bunny rescue organization find homes
                                for bunnies, such as Kibbles. This cuddly Dalmatian bunny is part of the large Chase
                                household, which also includes two dogs, three cats, and a turtle.</p>

                            <p>Leroy walked into Dr. Sanders' front door when she was moving into a new house. After
                                searching for weeks for Leroy's guardians, she decided to make Leroy a part of her pet
                                family. Leroy has settled into his new home, and especially enjoys playing with Dr. Sanders'
                                other cats.</p>
